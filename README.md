# Warp Utilities

A series of high level utilities that perform functions you might generally use scripts for.
It is meant to make certain types of operations easy to perform.

## Warp Removal

A file removal utility that provides a way to remove files with the same name but different extension formats.
This is particularly useful for cleaning up photos, since `.jpg` is a very fast format to load and view while `raw` files are very slow.
This makes viewing initial files very easy, and deleting a `jpeg` on the first pass one could use this utility remove all the `raw` files without a matching `jpeg`.
